To activate the laptops around the **Terminus** map in _Call of Duty: Black Ops 6_ (BO6) Zombies, follow these detailed steps:

## Step-by-Step Guide to Activating Laptops

### 1. Locate the Laptops

There are three laptops that you need to find and activate. They are not highlighted, so you'll need to explore the map to locate them. Here are their specific locations:

- **Laptop 1**: Near the Stamin-Up room, up the stairs overlooking the center of the map.
- **Laptop 2**: Outside the Quick Revive room. Exit through the door facing away from spawn, and it will be directly in front of you.
- **Laptop 3**: At the docks, up the stairs from the Arsenal station next to the water

### 2. Activating Each Laptop

- Approach each laptop and press the interact button (usually indicated by a prompt on your screen)
- Once activated, each laptop will display a symbol along with a corresponding number on sticky notes
- Take note of these numbers as they will be used later to solve the math equations

### 3. Collecting Information

After activating all three laptops, you will have three symbols and their associated numbers (X, Y, Z). The symbols may change with each game session, so it's essential to record them each time you play.
